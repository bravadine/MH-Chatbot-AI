Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, usually about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome. It is a normal and often healthy emotion, but when a person regularly experiences disproportionate levels of anxiety, it may become a medical disorder. Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent and excessive fear or worry, and can interfere with a person's ability to lead a normal life. Symptoms may include restlessness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and sleep problems. Anxiety disorders can be treated with therapy and medication.."
